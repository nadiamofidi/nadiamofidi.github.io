Teaching has been a lifelong passion, rooted in my upbringing as the child of two dedicated teachers. From an early age, I was immersed in conversations about teaching methodologies, often comparing my learning experiences and teachers’ approaches with the practices my parents shared. This constant exposure cultivated my observant nature, allowing me to identify effective teaching techniques and the importance of tailoring methods to individual needs.
My teaching journey began at the age of 10, tutoring mathematics to peers and younger classes. Later, as a teenager, I actively mentored younger students in high school, guiding them in mathematics, physics, and chemistry, as well as their overall learning pathways, helping them develop strategies to succeed in their studies. During my postgraduate years, I added a pedagogical basis to this passion by enrolling in scientific teaching and inclusivity courses. These courses helped me to enhance my ability to engage diverse learners and create an inclusive classroom environment."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nadiamofidi.com/teaching/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.9de45e225101e4f99701d2b68fc6b8a1ef6027928be6391fa15bf7f56326c909.css integrity="sha256-neReIlEB5PmXAdK2j8a4oe9gJ5KL5jkfoVv39WMmyQk=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nadiamofidi.com/teaching/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nadiamofidi.com/teaching/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nadia Mofidi"><meta property="og:title" content="Nadia Mofidi"><meta property="og:description" content="Teaching Teaching has been a lifelong passion, rooted in my upbringing as the child of two dedicated teachers.
