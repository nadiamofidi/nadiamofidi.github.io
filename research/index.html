Introduction and Experience
My academic research journey began in 2007 with a project modelling a small jet engine from air intake to nozzle using Simulink for testing purposes. By applying the first principles of fluid dynamics and insights from my aerodynamics course, I developed a framework to predict changes in air pressure and temperature, demonstrating an early aptitude for bridging theory and practice. In 2012, I pursued my interest in Watermist systems, a sustainable fire suppression technology. I modelled a few scenarios by self-teaching the use of Fire Dynamic Simulator (FDS) and I presented my findings at European conferences, expanding my research network and paving the way for my master’s degree. Over the past decade, I have led and contributed to over 10 research projects and supervised MSc students in fire science and combustion laboratories. A key achievement was designing, procuring, and commissioning a mobile FTIR package integrated with the Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA), significantly advancing experimental capabilities and deepening our understanding of combustion species in the Fire Science lab in Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI)."><meta name=author content><link rel=canonical href=https://nadiamofidi.com/research/><meta name=google-site-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=yandex-verification content="XYZabc"><meta name=msvalidate.01 content="XYZabc"><link crossorigin=anonymous href=/assets/css/stylesheet.9de45e225101e4f99701d2b68fc6b8a1ef6027928be6391fa15bf7f56326c909.css integrity="sha256-neReIlEB5PmXAdK2j8a4oe9gJ5KL5jkfoVv39WMmyQk=" rel="preload stylesheet" as=style><link rel=icon href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=apple-touch-icon href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><link rel=mask-icon href=https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E><meta name=theme-color content="#2e2e33"><meta name=msapplication-TileColor content="#2e2e33"><link rel=alternate hreflang=en href=https://nadiamofidi.com/research/><noscript><style>#theme-toggle,.top-link{display:none}</style></noscript><meta property="og:url" content="https://nadiamofidi.com/research/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Nadia Mofidi"><meta property="og:title" content="Nadia Mofidi"><meta property="og:description" content="Research Introduction and Experience My academic research journey began in 2007 with a project modelling a small jet engine from air intake to nozzle using Simulink for testing purposes.

A key achievement was designing, procuring, and commissioning a mobile FTIR package integrated with the Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA), significantly advancing experimental capabilities and deepening our understanding of combustion species in the Fire Science lab in Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI).\nIn 2023, I undertook a sabbatical in Japan to study traditional and modern timber construction, visiting the Horyu-ji temple and engaging with leading construction firms to explore sustainable practices inspired by nature. My recent wildfire research extends into geology, examining how factors like soil composition, topography, and wind influence flame spread. By integrating big data analytics into wildfire risk modelling, I contributed to the UK Climate Resilience Roadmap project, collaborating with the UK Green Building Council to develop wildfire risk assessment methodologies. This interdisciplinary approach has allowed me to bridge knowledge gaps between fire science, geology, and data science, enabling me to address global challenges while fostering resilient and sustainable communities.\nMSc Research Project 1: In-Situ burning: a solution to clean polluted shorelines after an oil spill I conducted a project investigating the flame spread and burning rate of fuel-soaked sand to mimic polluted shorelines following an oil spill. The goal was to optimise the design and arrangement of trenches to enhance flame spread and burning efficiency, providing a rapid and accessible solution for removing spilled fuel through in-situ burning. This method offers significant environmental and logistical advantages, particularly in remote areas where traditional cleanup techniques are challenging. My proposal for this innovative approach won a $15,000 grant from the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA), highlighting its potential and impact. I presented the initial results of this research at the 2017 National Meeting of the Combustion Institute, where it was well-received for its contribution to advancing practical solutions in fire and environmental science. The findings demonstrated how controlled trench arrangements could significantly improve the effectiveness of in-situ burning, offering a scalable method for mitigating oil spill damage. The final paper from this project is currently being drafted, aiming to refine the methodology further and provide actionable insights into its broader application. This research reflects my commitment to developing innovative, practical solutions to critical environmental challenges.\nMSc Research project 2: Influence of Fuel-to-Air Ratio on Wildland Flame Soot Particles This study, I investigated the influence of the fuel-to-air ratio and flame heat feedback on the shape and size of wildfire soot particles, challenging existing assumptions in radiation models that treat soot particles as uniformly spherical. Using a Fire Propagation Apparatus (FPA), experiments were conducted on burning pine needles under controlled oxygen concentrations (21% to 16%) to simulate various forest bed conditions, with additional heat feedback applied to replicate flame dynamics. Soot particles were collected at different plume heights and analysed via Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), revealing significant variations in particle morphology under different conditions. I presented the findings, at the 11th US National Combustion Meeting, highlight critical gaps in existing models, improving CFD wildfire radiation predictions and contributing to a better understanding of wildfire soot’s impact on climate dynamics. This research advances strategies to mitigate wildfire risks and supports efforts to refine predictive tools for climate and fire behaviour analysis and opened conversations with other research institutes such as Sandia National Laboratories.\nPhD Research: Air Entrainment Structure in a Turbulent Diffusion Flame Under Cross Wind: A Three-Dimensional Perspective My PhD research, conducted at WPI and University College London (UCL), explored the interaction between crosswind and buoyant turbulent diffusion flames, addressing a critical challenge in fire science. This work is particularly relevant to understanding wildfire behaviour, where strong winds complicate firefighting efforts by spreading embers and enabling flames to leap natural barriers, posing severe risks to wildland-urban interface (WUI) communities and first responders. Using a large-scale wind tunnel at WPI, I designed and executed experiments to study the effects of wind speeds (0.3 m/s to 3 m/s), burner surface areas, and fuel injection velocities on flame structure and air entrainment. By analysing over 900 video datasets with MATLAB and Python, I constructed 3D flame geometries and identified key parameters influencing flame dynamics. This research bridged gaps in understanding air entrainment mechanisms and the interplay between wind, buoyancy, and turbulence in crosswind flames. The findings provide valuable insights into wildfire and tunnel fire modelling, offering practical contributions to improving firefighting strategies, city evacuation planning, and environmental protection efforts.\n","wordCount":"851","inLanguage":"en","image":"https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20or%20path%20of%20image%20for%20opengraph,%20twitter-cards%3E","datePublished":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://nadiamofidi.com/research/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Nadia Mofidi","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://nadiamofidi.com/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body class=dark id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"&&document.body.classList.remove("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/ accesskey=h title="Nadia Mofidi (Alt + H)"><img src=https://nadiamofidi.com/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Nadia Mofidi</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/about/ title=about><span>about</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/cv/ title=cv><span>cv</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/research/ title=research><span class=active>research</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/teaching/ title=teaching><span>teaching</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/contact/ title=contact><span>contact</span></a></li><li><a href=https://nadiamofidi.com/dancing/ title=dancing><span>dancing</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><h1 class="post-title entry-hint-parent"></h1><div class=post-meta></div></header><div class=post-content><h2 id=research>Research<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#research>#</a></h2><h3 id=introduction-and-experience>Introduction and Experience<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction-and-experience>#</a></h3><p>My academic research journey began in 2007 with a project modelling a small jet engine from air intake to nozzle using Simulink for testing purposes.
